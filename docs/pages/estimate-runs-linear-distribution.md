# The <code>estimate_runs_linear_distribution</code> executable

## Synopsis
```console
Synopsis: mpirun estimate_runs_linear_distribution \
   [ -v-bound <v-bound> ] <distribution> { <distribution> }
```
Estimates the number of runs required to solve a linear distribution for a logarithm $d$ or order $r$ depending on the type of distribution input with at least 99\% success probability when accepting to enumerate at most $B_v$ vectors in the lattice.

The results are written to the console and to <code>logs/estimate-runs-linear.txt</code>.

> <b>Note:</b> This is an MPI program. The node with rank zero acts as server. All other nodes are clients, requesting jobs from and reporting back to the server node. A minimum of two nodes is hence required.

### Mandatory command line arguments
Arguments <code>\<distribution\></code> where
- <code>\<distribution\></code> is the path to a distribution

### Optional command line arguments
Flag specifying the bound $B_v$ in $v$ (defaults to 2):
- <code>-v-bound <v-bound\></code> sets the bound $B_v$ to <code>\<v-bound\></code>

## Interpreting the output
The log file <code>logs/estimate-runs-linear.txt</code> is on the format

where we find $m$, $s$ or $\ell$, $n$ â€” $\tau$, $v$, \<#errors\> on each line, and where
- $m$ is the bit length of the logarithm $d$ or order $r$,
- $s$ is the tradeoff factor such that $\ell = \lceil m / s \rceil$, if $s$ was specified when the distribution was generated, otherwise $\ell$ is explicitly stated instead,
- $n$ is the number of runs,
- $\tau$ is a value related to the radius $R$,
- $v$ is the number of vectors that we at most expect to have to enumerate, and
- #errors is the number of sets of $n$ simulated outputs for which $R$ was set to infinity due to sampling errors.

Note that the executable first computes estimates for $n = s$ and $n = s + 1$. It then interpolates a guess for the correct $n$ by using that $v$ is reduced by approximately a constant factor for every increment of $n$ by one. Depending on whether this guess is above or below the bound, $n$ is then increased or decreased until the smallest $n$ that satisfies the bound on $v$ has been found.
