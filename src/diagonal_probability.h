 * \brief   Computes h(phi).

 * This function uses the heuristic approximation h in the paper [1] by Eker책 on

 * [1] Eker책, M.: Revisiting Shor's quantum algorithm for computing general

 *
 * Since the probability is high when theta_r d/r is very close to theta_d, this
 * function uses higher precision than the default precision of #PRECISION
 * internally to ensure numeric stability.
 *
 * You typically need to set a high precision, on the order of m + sigma bits,
 * in phi = theta_d - theta_r d/r when calling this function. This function has
 * been tested with a precision of 2 (m + sigma) bits in phi. This is the
 * recommended precision setting.
 *
 * \param[in, out] norm     The approximate probability for the pair.
 * \param[in] phi           The angle phi = theta_d - theta_r d/r.
 * \param[in] parameters    The parameters for the probability distribution.
